         <h3> Description</h3>
         <p> My game consists of a pokemon battle based game with a magic/fantasy esque theme.
         <br>My scoring system was based upon the same as pokemon, with the addition of a "Combo Charge",
         <br>a special condition that allows for more spells to be created. The randomness occurs during the 
         <br>enemies' attacks. The game gets difficult as the game progesses and you continue to battle enemies.
         <br>The game finally ends when you defeat all enemies or lose if you health falls to 0.
         </p>
         
         <h3>Reflection</h3>
         <p> I made this game because I really like pokemon's system and I wanted to take a magical take on
         <br>it while making it RPG based. My two successful points are setting all my sprites and setting the 
         <br>battle system such as making the health fall and so on. Two obstacles I came across was the complexity
         <br>of the system and the amount of effort and time needed to fix things and set an idea. It took a while for
         <br>me to figure things out and I slowly ran out of time and couldn't finish my project. If I had more time,
         <br>I would've completely finished my game and made it look smoother.

         <p>I chose this algorithm as it is the basis of my battle system. It allows me to set rules for how the hp falls.</p>
