        <h3> Description</h3>
         <p> My game consists of a pokemon battle based game with a magic/fantasy esque theme.
         <br>My scoring system was based upon the same as pokemon, with the addition of a "Combo Charge",
         <br>a special condition that allows for more spells to be created. The randomness occurs during the 
         <br>enemies' attacks. The game gets difficult as the game progesses and you continue to battle enemies.
         <br>The game finally ends when you defeat all enemies or lose if you health falls to 0.
         </p>
         
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
         <p> I made this game because I really like pokemon's system and I wanted to take a magical take on
         <br>it while making it RPG based. My two successful points are setting all my sprites and setting the 
         <br>battle system such as making the health fall and so on. Two obstacles I came across was the complexity
         <br>of the system and the amount of effort and time needed to fix things and set an idea. It took a while for
         <br>me to figure things out and I slowly ran out of time and couldn't finish my project. If I had more time,
         <br>I would've completely finished my game and made it look smoother.

         <p>I chose this algorithm as it is the basis of my battle system. It allows me to set rules for how the hp falls 
         <br>and what happens when the character's hp reaches zero.</p>

        <h1 id = "WW2">World War II ADVENTURE SIMULATOR</h1>
         <p> The WW2 Adventure Simulator features 6 different countries you can choose from during World War 2. All paths have you 
         <br> decide between being a infantry soldier or a commanding officer in that country. From there, you will see the results 
         <br> of your actions and either end up dead, alive, or in fact, both dead and alive.

         </a>
             
         <p> Regarding incremental processes, I collaboratively followed and developed the Flowchart ideas my teammate and I decided upon
         <br>and turned them into functions with names. As we continued adding functions, a minimal problem that showed up was the organization and incremental steps of our functions. 
         <br>As we added more functions, it became increasingly harder to keep setting the boolean expressions to the correct function name.
         <br>(Ex. if answer == 'I' or answer == 'i':
         <br>    french_infantry())
         <br>We solved this by renaming some of the functions to exactly fit what that certain situation was supposed to be for such as french_infantry_stay() and french_infantry_desert()
         <br>Regarding iterative processes, I independently sought out to add the stories with cleaner formatting and a consistent organizational method so that our 500+ lines of code do 
         <br>not have any errors and that it is easy to navigate if there were errors to occur. Generally, the difficulty in creating our code was low as we mostly kept the same formatting 
         <br>for all of our functions, with the addition of some extra paths and lines of code to expand our story.
         <br>
         <br>Organizing scenes of my story into functions is a form of procedural abstraction due to the fact that I assigned an appropriately named function to represent that procedural abstraction,
         <br>and in the main code, calling that function, trusting that it will actually carry out the order, and finally, writing a function body using an appropriate algorithm to do what we want.
         <br>The advantages of abstracting scenes into functions allows me to clearly see and carry out what I have in my mind and into something tangible and editable. This allows me to mentally 
         <br>control what I want to happen for my scenes and see how it will flow in the code.
         <br>
         <br>I enjoyed BANK HEI$T as it had some unexpected and surprising endings I did not think would happen. I also liked how they organized their functions and code in general.
